Does anyone else experience this? Is this what social anxiety is?\n",

Ever since I can't fall asleep on a random night (few months ago) , I started getting anxiety at night and before heading to bed but everyday is different. Usually, when I get on bed n off the lights, my body started to heat up and i would sweat a little which makes me really uncomfortable. My heart would pound fast to which makes me anxious.\n",

I need distractions but sometimes they don’t even work. My friends are beginning to call me snowflake now because I’ve been taking stuff that i didn’t used to take seriously seriously. And I’ve seen how they complain about other people so I can’t complain or talk to them. I know it sounds pathetic but reddit has been the only way I can talk about it because I can’t talk about it with anyone else. I’m a fucking pathetic piece of shit for this because I’m becoming a burden to everyone around me.\n",

I’m sure it goes on some kind of record somewhere but like where and who can see it? Employers? Do I lose any rights? I shoot targets for fun a lot, it’s one of my few hobbies, but if I’m hospitalized do I lose my right to own a gun? Any other things that happen that I’m not aware of?

Why does it take so long to study proteins or the exact structure of a protein?  They also say it takes millions of dollars and very long time and meaning scientists were only able to study a tiny fraction of them. This slowed down research to tackle disease and find new medicines.  Why does it take so long to find the exact structure of a protein and so important to tackle disease and find new medicines?\n",

Do you know what it's like to constantly feel uncomfortable in your own skin but you can never turn it off? this is the answer I give when people ask me what's wrong, because there's always more than one thing going on at the same time. I find myself drinking more than i'd like to admit,I never drank before this, anything to take the edge off. I feel like I'm having to teach myself everything all over again, I don't even know how to formulate that into words.\n",
      "5300 | ptsd | He also tortured me in several other ways, like subduing me and pressing his knee into my temple or heatbutting me in the nose as a way to start a fight. I started taking martial arts and self defense classes and I started retaliating against him, when I was around 15. He'd also hit my mom sometimes and I'd protect her. One time while trying to avoid his chokes I cut my head so bad that blood was gushing all over the room - and when I got him off me, he came back and headbutted me in the nose and tried to choke me again, after which I threw him over the table. The whole room was covered in my blood and he was still relentless.\n",
      "1184 | ptsd | I just don't know what's real anymore. I can't live with everyone in my life thinking that I'm crazy AND a hysterical slut. I just can't do this anymore. I'm so ashamed I can't be in this skin anymore. I'm starting to get scared.\n",

I don’t see any other way out. I don’t think it’ll happen this week but I can’t promise next week. I have no passion for anything in my life nor do I have fun anymore.

These ingredients take an incredible amount of time to reach perfection, yet often come with a note of the packaging to use the product within a set period of time; sometimes a week, sometimes a couple of months.   It makes me wonder why these things can sit happily for years in a cave or a production facility, but start to go south the minute they get to the consumer. So, explain it like I'm five, please!\n",
      "1 | When we are at work we joke around but we all do that. I feel so ashamed. I want to hear your opinion on the fact am i to blame? Was it my fault because something like this happened? **tl;dr**: Something delicate happened between me and my collegue\n",
      "2 | 1 year ago, I left for good. I was a reddit lurker for a while but never made an account. The day I left, I felt so free, yet I was the loneliest I’ve ever felt . I was completely lost and confused. I made a reddit account this day a year ago and found comfort in this platform. I am not the same person I was a year ago and it has been so hard piecing myself together. I’ve learned many things along the way. I am still growing and working on myself. I still have a long way to go but I feel way better than I did a year ago.   Happy cake day.\n",
      "3 | someone once told me smoking weed and then touching a baby or small animal can somehow make them high? is that horseshit?\n",
      "4 | The main source of this stress is a scholarship I am on that requires payback if you lose it, meaning I would be in the whole about $20,000 if I fail and get kicked out. The contract states you can either be kicked out or placed on probation, but I cannot find any precedent on what direction they lean. Without diving into many specifics on this class and the great, and I emphasize great, impact it can have on this scholarship \\(I wouldn't be able to get my AE degree\\), I was hoping I could find some advice on increasing my productivity and generally improving my mental/physical health. I am reaching here, I really need some help. My fiance, bless her heart, is not much help because of planning the wedding and I don't have a lot of close friends/confidants.\n",
      "5 | Context: I have had a very busy last 2 weeks getting an average of 5 hours sleep per night. Today I woke up with fever and chills and people say it’s because I overexerted. Isn’t illness caused by virus/bacteria? How does that relate to sleep or busyness?\n",
      "6 | First off I'm male but my relationship with the woman is strictly platonic stemming from professional, we are co-workers. It's no secret to anyone that she's in an abusive relationship as she's come to work several times over the last several months with blackeyes etc and admits to being abused. She been in the relationship for 1.5 years which turned   info is out of the way, here's the new twist that has brought me to split roads. Yesterday she showed me a text from him detailing how angry he'd been at her 12 yr old and that if he didn't have so much will power he would have choked her son to death and that she needs to get her son to behave so he doesn't have to crack his skull. I encouraged her to show that to Leo and have him removed from the apartment as well as get an order of protection, she seemed to be considering that but has expressed fear of retaliation in the past.\n",
      "7 | why does it hurt so much? Why can’t I be happy without it? There’s this empty void in my heart that gets bigger everyday. I’m just waiting until it eats me up, since I’ll never have 2 sided love.\n",
      "8 | I’m so alone... I’m almost 20 and I’ve never been in a relationship before. I’ve only been rejected by 4 guys and 2 girls. One of them is my closest friend. He says that if I was a girl he would be with me. This makes me feel like I have to change myself in order to be his. Even then I still don’t think he’ll be with me. I’m in love with him because he’s one of the only people who makes me feel like I matter. I just wonder if I’m even going to have anyone in the future... Dating websites/apps are also out of the question because no one wants to talk to me no matter how hard I try.\n",
      "9 | Am i simply lazy or is there something more? If this doesn't fit this sub please delete.  I'll be short, not the best writer. I am university student, 25, about to get bachelors degree in programming. Never had a job , leeching from mom. After four years of study i realized that at best i am average, at worst i am below that. Before going to psychiatrist(spelling?), decided to \"look around\" and see  if there is basis for it or not.  Now,apart from feeling useless and generally thinking that i have no future. I simply don't have any motivation.   I know i need to do things, i want to do them, but simply cant gather up motivation or focus to do them. I keep switching between other things, starting to watch videos , only to switch to another one, reading articles, browsing reddit until it's too late to do anything.  Then promising i'll do it tomorrow. Worst thing is that i don't really care if i fail.  Anyone experienced something similar?   TL,DR: Can't gather motivation to do anything, i need to do it, want to do it, but simply can't start doing it. Keep switching between doing other things instead.  Anyone has any similar experience?\n",
      "10 | i was having another \"one of those days\" and was quite frustrated with the way i was feeling.\n",
      "11 | my first ever boyfriend just broke up with me after confronting him about cheating. i know what he did was wrong, so why do i still love him? he helped me with my depression and anxiety episodes, he literally just dropped me as if i was worth nothing and it hurts so bad. i feel empty, i dont wanna go back to how i was. back to feeling lonely and worthless of love, how do i move forward when all i want is to disappear, everything reminds me of him and i cant stop crying\n",
      "12 | I hate to say goodbye to her, I hate to cry this hard, but either way I'd hate to live to see the sun rise in the morning.\n",
      "13 | My family is from a country in Asia where Eastern naming order is used. Out of curiosity, I looked up the other countries that use it and found that Hungary was one of them even though the rest of Europe uses some form of Western naming order. Why is that?  Example of Hungarian name with Eastern naming convention: Szoboszlai Dominik (where Szoboszlai is the surname)\n",
      "14 | Finally going to doctors Put off many appointments because of my anxiety. Wish me luck\n",
      "15 | I’m glad none of my close friends know I have reddit If my friends knew how depressed I was and I how serious I am about committing suicide they would probably put me in some inpatient program. That would just make things worse tbh. The only time I feel okay is it work because I feel needed and I’m helping people.   Everyday is a constant struggle to stay alive and I hate that there’s still a month and half left until the date I chose. I should probably write my letters soon just Incase I don’t make it.   I’m glad for this subreddit and that there’s people who understand my pain.\n",
      "16 | I still don't know what I want to do with my life and it's worrying me.\n",
      "17 | I should be an actor... I feel like most people who have depression could work in theatre or movies. I don't know how you guys feel about putting on an act when really you feel so sad that it's hard to breathe, but recently I have been having to act like I am getting better from depression. My roommate confide\n"
